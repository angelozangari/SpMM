# An Efficient Gustavson-based Sparse Matrix-matrix Multiplication Accelerator on Embedded FPGAs

We implement and evaluate the design on the Xilinx ZCU106 platform. We synthesis and generate the bitstream using the Xilinx Vitis toolchain v2022.1.

+ The ***HLS*** folder includes the source code of SpMM design. 
+ The ***SDK*** folder includes the driver code for the FPGA design in the Vitis IDE.
